# Event Target for GoogleCloudStorage 
This event target integrates with GoogleCloudStorage, using received Cloud Event messages to create Blob items.

## Prerequisites

* A storage bucket is expected to exist prior to running this event target. If you haven't already done so, create a bucket by following the instructions from the [Cloud Storage How-To Guides](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/how-to).

* A [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts)  along with its respective [key in JSON format](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) is required to authenticate the event target and allow it to interact with Google.


## Deploying an Instance of the Target
Open the Bridge creation screen and add a Target of type `Google Cloud Storage`.
